**Project Brief:**

Every week, North Coast Logistics, Inc., enters the latitude and longitude, in decimal degrees, for a number of cities that need to be visited by a truck on a single trip. 

Your team has been asked to develop a Python program for determining the order in which to visit each city on the list exactly once
for a delivery or pickup and return to the starting city so as to travel as little total distance as you can.

-----

Example data may be found in project2.xlsx. The python script intakes a file path from the user to the excel file containing the cities and their geographical coordinates.
The script then calculates a path using a simple greedy algorithm before outputting the results in both the console and into the original excel file.
